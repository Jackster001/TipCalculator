## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

One of main challenges I have encountered was the syntax which I was not use to. After watching a couple of videos on youtube, I was able to understand how certain code works, such as the special marker -> @IBOutlet. The hardest part was making everything work cohesively from the classes to the UI.
